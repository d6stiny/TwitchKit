Hereâ€™s how to connect to Twitch chat and listen for messages:

```swift

import TwitchKit

let twitch = TwitchKit()

// Configure with your Twitch credentials
twitch.configure(username: "your_username", token: "oauth:your_oauth_token", channel: "channel_to_join")

// Set up event handlers
twitch.onConnect = {
    print("Connected to Twitch chat!")
}

twitch.onMessage = { message in
    print("\(message.displayName): \(message.message)")
}

twitch.onError = { error in
    print("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}

// Connect to Twitch chat
twitch.connect()

// To disconnect when you're done
